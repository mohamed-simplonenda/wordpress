Add an option to your WooCommerce products to enable assembly, gift wrap or any other service and optionally charge a fee for it.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add an option to your WooCommerce products to enable assembly, gift wrap or any other service and optionally charge a fee for it.

In WooCommerce > Settings > Products you can set up the default service status and cost, the service name, the message and the way the costs are shown on the cart.

If the customer chooses to add the service when buying the product, that information is shown in the cart and orders. The service cost can be added to the cart as a global fee, instead of at the product level, to avoid discount plugins to also affect it.
